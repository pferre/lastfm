LastFM API Client 
========================
Simple LastFM consumer application, to display statistics for a user based on
their listening habits. Very few options available at this stage, but will be 
looking to add more features as I go.

Few consumer endpoints currently available:
* [user.getinfo] (http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getInfo) - Maps to the Homepage
for this particular app for the moment.
* [user.gettoptracks](http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getTopTracks) - Maps to /{user}/toptracks
